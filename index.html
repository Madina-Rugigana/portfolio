    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a Dynamic Software Engineering student pivoting my skills to become a top-tier Software Quality and Test Engineer. My background is defined by a commitment to delivering high-quality, thoroughly tested software solutionsâ€”the kind that users trust and enjoy.

        My technical toolbox includes manual and automated testing, meticulous creation and execution of test cases, and precise defect reporting. I'm experienced in collaborating within fast-paced Agile teams, consistently focusing on analyzing system performance to significantly improve overall product quality.

        But what truly drives me is my enthusiasm for design. I don't just test the code; I evaluate the entire experience. This unique perspective means I bring a sharp focus not only to what breaks, but to why the user experience might be confusing or inconsistent.

        My goal? To be the final, crucial checkpoint that ensures every application is both technically sound and visually seamless.</p>
